      <p> 
        Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition arising from experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. Though it is commonly associated with soldiers, this condition may affect anyone regardless of age or life experience. The aim of this site is to help raise awareness for PTSD and advocate for survivors, as well as help younger survivors understand their feelings as well as learn how to cope. We hope this leads to a more empathetic society where survivors feel less lonely and are able to build a happier future for themselves!

                A natural reaction to perceived threats, we may become defensive or aggressive in an attempt to protect ourselves. This may cause us to lash out physically or verbally.

                Stress leads us to become immobile, which may be compared to stage fright. Our emotions might numb themselves to protect us from overwhelming situations.

        <h3>What ARE fear responses?</h3>
        <p>
          Fear responses are the body's way of protecting ourselves from threats, evolving from the need to survive in dangerous situations such as while hunting. These may seem counter-productive today, with certain responses such as Freeze, Flop and Fawn being less understood and instead leading to stigma. However, these responses are still vital in protecting us during traumatic situations, and as such it is important to raise awareness about them. With this, we can reduce shame and increase empathy, leading to a happier and healthier future for survivors.

                <p class="card-text">
                  The most common symptom of PTSD is re-living traumatic events as though they are happening in the moment. This may not be literal memories playing in your mind but sensations, such as sound, smell and touch. It can also manifest as disturbing memories, nightmares or a sense of dread, as well as physical symptoms such as nausea or shivering.<br> <br>
                  These feelings may be triggered by familiar places or situations, even subconscious signals that may lead to confusion and distress.

                <p class="card-text">
                  Living with trauma may cause conflicting feelings, such as explosions of anger and sadness or numbness and a lack of interest or motivation. This may stifle positive feelings like joy and evolve into fixating on negative thoughts, leading to low self-esteem, guilt and shame. It can also lead to loneliness, becoming wary of those around you and feeling anxious as a result. <br> <br>
                  It is common for PTSD to occur alongside other mental health conditions such as major depressive disorder or generalised anxiety.

                <p class="card-text">
                  It is common for PTSD to result in heightened awareness, leading survivors to frequently be on the lookout for threats. Even in seemingly safe situations, there may be lingering dread leading to anxiety and a need to remain constantly alert. This may affect sleep and make survivors easily startled, impairing concentration and causing hypersensitivity. <br> <br>
                  This may lead to panic attacks, sudden bursts of anxiety which can trigger physical symptoms like shaking, sweating and having a quick heartbeat.

                <p class="card-text">
                  Survivors often have the urge to avoid people, places and situations that may remind them of traumatic events, which may impair everyday life. When this is not physically possible, other measures may be taken to avoid fixating on the unwanted feelings. This may manifest as overworking or engaging in risky behaviours to keep occupied or numb the feelings as they come. Because of this, PTSD is often comorbid with various forms of addiction. <br><br>

          <p>There are additional measures that the brain may take to avoid further traumatising experiences, such as dissociation. Dissociation is an experience where your emotions and sensations are numbed. This may have effects such as the world around you feeling unreal or you may struggle to recognise feelings within yourself. In severe cases, memories of past trauma may be blocked out partially or completely. </p>
