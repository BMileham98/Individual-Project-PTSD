# Individual-Project-PTSD

## Introduction


(Placeholder) is my first individual project born from my studies of HTML and CSS with Code Institute's Full Stack Bootcamp. My desire for this project is to help spread awareness of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in a manner that is more digestible, especially for young survivors and their loved ones.

I chose this subject to test my newfound knowledge of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap because it is something I am passionate about and I would love to make this particular topic less frightening for those affected.

## UX Design

### Goal

The creator designed this site to be easy to navigate and interactive, with careful thought put into making a stress-free experience for the user. Therefore the project was designed to be responsive across various devices, created with a mobile-first approach as this is the most commonly used and convenient device to search for mental health support.

### Wireframes

These wireframes were created with Balsamiq, referring to the original planned designs for the site in both desktop and mobile formats. Having this basic framework made it easier to visualise the layout while I was creating it with HTML.
